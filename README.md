I notice the website is returning an error page instead of the expected snow data. Since I cannot access the actual data from the HTML provided (it shows a service error), I cannot extract the current values.

Based on the error page shown, the NOAA website appears to be experiencing technical difficulties. Without access to the actual data table, I cannot provide the current snow measurements for the Island Park station.

### Data:
- Snow Water Equivalent (SWE): Water content of the snowpack in inches
- Snow Depth: Total depth of snow in inches
- Snow Density: Ratio of water weight to snow volume as a percentage
- Last Updated: UTC timestamp of the most recent measurement
