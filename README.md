## Project Description

This repository monitors the snow water equivalent (SWE) at a small cabin in Island Park, Idaho. The SWE data is automatically fetched daily from the NOAA Island Park (ISPI1) snow monitoring station.

### Purpose
Monitor snow conditions to determine when roof shoveling is needed. A warning is issued when SWE exceeds 10 inches.

### Data Source
- Station: Island Park (ISPI1)
- URL: https://www.nwrfc.noaa.gov/snow/snowplot.cgi?ISPI1
- Data updated daily at 06:00 Mountain Time

### Data Fields
- **Snow Water Equivalent (SWE)**: Water content of the snowpack in inches
- **Snow Depth**: Total depth of snow in inches
- **Snow Density**: Ratio of water weight to snow volume as a percentage
- **Last Updated**: UTC timestamp of the most recent measurement
