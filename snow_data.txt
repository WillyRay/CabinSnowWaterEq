I notice the website is returning an error page instead of the expected snow data. Since I cannot access the actual data from the HTML provided (it shows a service error), I cannot extract the current values.

Based on the error page shown, the NOAA website appears to be experiencing technical difficulties. Without access to the actual data table, I cannot provide the current snow measurements for the Island Park station.
